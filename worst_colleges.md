We can draw some useful advice from this:

1. Don't be from a poor geography.
2. Be a beauty-school dropout.
3. Don't trust Mr Leon.


That's a quick look (using `csvkit`).

The next obvious question is, how can we adjust for some of the geographic factors?
Little Big Horn, [Shreveport](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOcnITphyjk "This might be Lake Charles rather than Shreveport, but it captures a bit of Louisiana for you if you haven't been through there."), Gem City, Hot Springs, Hemet/Moreno Valley, Waterville, and Bangor
(all of which I think I've seen in person) are not high on the list of places with
employment opportunities bursting out of the stitching.


My next idea is to try to adjust for _family_ income. That should cover both Empire
Beauty School in Manhattan, and the "South Dakota effect".
